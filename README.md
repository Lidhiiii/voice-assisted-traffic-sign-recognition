Voice-Assisted Traffic Sign Recognition
This project is a deep learning-based traffic sign recognition system developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
It is enhanced with voice assistance using pyttsx3, a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. 
The application identifies traffic signs from images and provides audio feedback, making it useful for visually impaired users or driver-assistance systems.
